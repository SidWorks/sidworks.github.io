          <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
          <p>We define programming, as a general human activity, to mean the act of extending or changing
            a
            system’s
            functionality. Programming is a widespread activity that is done both by nonspecialists (e.g., consumers
            who
            change the settings of their alarm clock or cellular phone) and specialists (computer programmers, the
            audience for this article).</p>


          <h2>Javascript : The language</h2>
          <p>The most popular Programming language today.<br>Some of the most powerful
            Software are written in JavaScript today.<br>But how many folks do actually understand this
            language?<br>Probabily this the only language which is used(usually in scripts) before it is fully
            understood. <br>Javascript is a powerful programming language but Weird at the same time.<br>We can’t deny
            this fact but overall it is a beautiful Programming languange.</p>

          <p>Have you Ever Wondered,how do those assortments of programming statements
            tell
            the Computer what to do?</p>
          <blockquote>
            <h3 style="color: grey;margin: 10px;">Statements like a
              =
              a + 2 are helpful for developers when reading and writing, but are not actually in a form the computer
              can directly understand.</h3>
          </blockquote>
          <p>So an uncommon utility on the Computer (either a<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4ax90XmUBc"
              target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"> interpreter or a
              compiler</em></a>) is utilized to decipher the
            code you compose into directions that a Computer can comprehend!</p>
          <p>For some computer languages, this translation of commands is typically done
            from top to bottom, line by line, every time the program is run, which is usually called
            interpreting the code.</p>
          <p>For other languages, the translation is done ahead of time, called compiling
            the code, so when the program runs later, what’s running is actually the already compiled computer
            instructions ready to go.</p>
          <blockquote style="color: grey;margin: 10px;">
            <h3>It’s typically
              asserted that <strong">JavaScript is interpreted, because your
                JavaScript source code is processed each time it’s run.<a
                  href="https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/138521/is-javascript-interpreted-by-design"
                  target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"> But that’s not entirely
                  accurate.</a></h3>
            " The JavaScript
            engine actually compiles the program on the fly and then immediately runs the compiled code. "
          </blockquote>
          <p>In this article we will LEARN about some essential concepts that will help
            you
            to understand what actually happens under the hood.<br>And by the endof the article you will have a clear
            understanding of what actually happens when you write a Javascript. CODE</p>
          <p>Concepts that we will learn here are :</p>
          <ul class="h3">
            <li>Syntax Parsers</li> <br>
            <li>Execution Contexts</li> <br>

          </ul>
          <p>Understanding Syntax Parsers, Execution Contexts, and Lexical Environments
            in
            a Simple Language.</p>
          <p> All three of
            these
            are complicated sounding terms that actually aren’t that difficult to understand.</p>
          </p>

          <p>
            <h3>SYNTAX PARSER : A PROGRAM THAT READS YOUR CODE AND DETERMINES
              WHAT IT
              DOES
              AND IF IT’S GRAMMAR OR SYNTAX IS VALID</h3>
          </p>
          <p>So when you write JavaScript it isn’t magically directly telling the
            computer
            what to do , you are <a href="https://esprima.org/demo/parse.html" class="bw fd it iu iv iw" target="_blank"
              rel="noopener nofollow">abstracted away</a> from all of that you are writing code!
            but
            then someone else or other people built programs that convert your JavaScript into something the
            computer
            can understand.</p>
          <p>Was it too hard?</p>

          <p>Those programs are called compilers and at times they also have to do
            with
            interpreters, but those programs <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4ax90XmUBc"
              class="bw fd it iu iv iw" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">interpreters and

              rel="noopener nofollow">character by character</em></a> and determining if the syntax
            is
            valid and then implementing that syntax in a way the computer can understand,</p>
          <p class="h3">So when you’re thinking about your code think of it

          <p>If you have a function with the
            variable,then
            that function and variable will be represented in memory but it’s being translated from what you have
            written what is more human readable to what the computer can understand. There’s a compiler or an
            interpreter between those two things and part of that is a syntax
            parser so, it’s going through your code</p>

          <p>character by character like f /u/ n/ c/ t/ i/ o /n <br>
            That is, it reads your code in characters (one by one) <br>
            <p>and it says :
              Oh!
              that’s a function 😃 <br> So, there should be a space after this ! and then the next thing I see up until
              the
              parenthesis ( ) will be the name of the function,</p>

            <p>above Greet is next
              thing
              the computer sees up until the parenthesis ( ) so it assumes that Greet will be the
              name of
              the function.</p>
            <p>And all this gets translated by the systems that someone
              else
              wrote but that also means that in that translation process ,the programmers who wrote the
              compiler
              can choose to do extra stuff .</p>
            <p>Your code is not what’s actually being given to the computer but a
              translation
              of it and so along the way the engine that is interpreting your code can decide to do other things
              those
              programmers could have chosen to do something else and in fact that’s going to come up as an important
              element of understanding JavaScript so that’s impacts parsers and thinking about the programs that are
              actually running every time you run your JavaScript code that intermediate program that’s creating
              your
              code.</p>
            <h3>Lexical Enviroments</h3>
            <p>The word lexical means having to do with words or
              grammar
              so we’re talking about the code you’re writing it’s syntax it’s vocabulary !</p>

            <p>Now a lexical environment exists in
              programming
              languages in which,where you write something which is It sounds kind of funny but actually not every
              programming language is
              that
              way, but remember we said you might have some code .</p>
            <p>let’s say a function with a variable inside of it the variable sits
              lexically
              inside the function ,that is : physically the code that you’re writing</em></p>

            <code style="font-size: larger;" ;">
              <hr>
              function greet() { <br>
              let message = 'Hello you there Beatiful Human' ; <br>
              } <br>
              <hr>
            </code>



            <p>function with a
              variable inside of it.that’s where it sits but remember we said that your code is not what’s
              actually given directly to the computer but it’s translated into something the computer can understand
            </p>
            <p>In programming languages where the lexical
              environment
              is important that means that where you see things written gives you an idea of where it
              will
              actually sit in the computer’s memory of how it will interact with other variables
              and functions and elements of the program and that’s because the program or the compiler
              that’s
              converting your code to those instructions cares about where you put things it makes decisions that
              syntax
              parts are going through everything makes decisions so when we talk about the lexical environment of
              something in the code we’re talking about where it’s written and what surrounds it got that.</p>
            <p>To help manage the code that is running there are lots of lexical
              environments
              areas of the code that you’re looking at physically but which one is currently actually running is
              managed
              via what’s called</p>
            <h3>EXECUTION CONTEXT:</h3>
            <h3>A WRAPPER TO HELP MANAGE THE CODE THAT IS
              RUNNING
            </h3>

            <p>There are lots of lexical environments which one i currently running id
              managed via execution contexts.it contain things beyond what you have written in your code</p>

            <p>And in execution context contains your code ,the running code and it’s
              running
              your code, but it also can contain things beyond what you’ve written in your code because remember
              again
              your code is being translated being processed by a whole other feature a whole other set of programs
              that
              someone else wrote and so it’s executing your code and it can do other things as well and that’s
              what’s
              happening inside JavaScript.</p>
            <p>Execution context is whole topic by itself
              which we will deal in some other article.</p>
