          <h2 class="h2">INTRODUCTION</h2>

          <p>We define programming, as a general human activity, to mean the act of extending or changing
            a
            systemâ€™s
            functionality. Programming is a widespread activity that is done both by nonspecialists (e.g., consumers who
            change the settings of their alarm clock or cellular phone) and specialists (computer programmers, the
            audience for this article).</p>
          <h2 class="h2">
            Javascript : The Language </h2>
          <p>The most popular Programming language today.
            Some of the most powerful Software are written in JavaScript today.
            But how many folks do actually understand this language?
            Probabily this the only language which is used(usually in scripts) before it is fully understood.
            Javascript is a powerful programming language but Weird at the same time.
            We canâ€™t deny this fact but overall it is a beautiful Programming languange.</p>
          <p> So,
            Have you Ever Wondered,how do those assortments of programming statements tell the Computer what to do?</p>
          <blockquote class="h3" style="color: grey;">Statements like a = a + 2 are helpful for developers when reading
            and writing, but are
            not
            actually in a form
            the computer can directly understand.</blockquote>
          <p>So an uncommon utility on the Computer (either a interpreter or a compiler) is utilized to decipher the
            code
            you compose into directions that a Computer can comprehend!</p>
          <p class="h3">For some computer languages, this translation of commands is typically done from top to bottom,
            line by line,
            every time the program is run, which is usually called interpreting the code.
            For other languages, the translation is done ahead of time, called compiling the code, so when the program
            runs later, whatâ€™s running is actually the already compiled computer instructions ready to go.</p>
          Itâ€™s typically asserted that JavaScript is interpreted, because your JavaScript source code is processed each
          time itâ€™s run. But thatâ€™s not entirely accurate.
          The JavaScript engine actually compiles the program on the fly and then immediately runs the compiled code.
          In this article we will LEARN about some essential concepts that will help you to understand what actually
          happens under the hood.
          And by the endof the article you will have a clear understanding of what actually happens when you write a
          Javascript. CODE
          Concepts that we will learn here are :
          Syntax Parsers
          Execution Contexts
          Lexical Enviroments
          Understanding Syntax Parsers, Execution Contexts, and Lexical Environments in a Simple Language.
          All three of these are complicated sounding terms that actually arenâ€™t that difficult to understand.
          SYNTAX PARSER :
          A PROGRAM THAT READS YOUR CODE AND DETERMINES WHAT IT DOES AND IF ITâ€™S GRAMMAR OR SYNTAX IS VALID
          So when you write JavaScript it isnâ€™t magically directly telling the computer what to do , you are abstracted
          away from all of that you are writing code! but then someone else or other people built programs that convert
          your JavaScript into something the computer can understand.
          Was it too hard?
          Those programs are called compilers and at times they also have to do with interpreters, but those programs
          interpreters and compilers do the process the work of actually reading your code character by character and
          determining if the syntax is valid and then implementing that syntax in a way the computer can understand,
          so when youâ€™re thinking about your code think of it more like :
          Code that you have Written and Which is human Readable
          and a program that is going to convert what computer can understand !
          Something like this:

          If you have a function with the variable,then that function and variable will be represented in memory but
          itâ€™s being translated from what you have written what is more human readable to what the computer can
          understand. Thereâ€™s a compiler or an interpreter between those two things and part of that is a syntax parser
          so, itâ€™s going through your code
          character by character like f /u/ n/ c/ t/ i/ o/ n
          That is, it reads your code in characters
          She is explaining How Computers Reads Your Code ðŸ˜‰
          and it says : Oh! thatâ€™s functionðŸ˜ƒ ,So there should be a space after this ! and then the next thing I see up
          until the parenthesis ( ) will be the name of the function,
          above Greet is next thing the computer sees up until the parenthesis ( ) so it assumes that Greet will be the
          name of the function.
          And all this gets translated by the systems that someone else wrote but that also means that in that
          translation process ,the programmers who wrote the compiler can choose to do extra stuff .
          Your code is not whatâ€™s actually being given to the computer but a translation of it and so along the way the
          engine that is interpreting your code can decide to do other things those programmers could have chosen to do
          something else and in fact thatâ€™s going to come up as an important element of understanding JavaScript so
          thatâ€™s impacts parsers and thinking about the programs that are actually running every time you run your
          JavaScript code that intermediate program thatâ€™s creating your code.
          LEXICAL ENVIRONMENT :
          The word lexical means having to do with words or grammar so weâ€™re talking about the code youâ€™re writing itâ€™s
          syntax itâ€™s vocabulary !
          Now a lexical environment exists in programming languages in which,where you write something which is
          important.
          It sounds kind of funny but actually not every programming language is that way, but remember we said you
          might have some code .
          letâ€™s say a function with a variable inside of it the variable sits lexically inside the function ,that is :
          physically the code that youâ€™re writing

          function with a variable inside of it.
          thatâ€™s where it sits but remember we said that your code is not whatâ€™s actually given directly to the computer
          but itâ€™s translated into something the computer can understand
          In programming languages where the lexical environment is important that means that where you see things
          written gives you an idea of where it will actually sit in the computerâ€™s memory of how it will interact with
          other variables and functions and elements of the program and thatâ€™s because the program or the compiler
          thatâ€™s converting your code to those instructions cares about where you put things it makes decisions that
          syntax parts are going through everything makes decisions so when we talk about the lexical environment of
          something in the code weâ€™re talking about where itâ€™s written and what surrounds it got that.
          To help manage the code that is running there are lots of lexical environments areas of the code that youâ€™re
          looking at physically but which one is currently actually running is managed via whatâ€™s called
          EXECUTION CONTEXT:
          A WRAPPER TO HELP MANAGE THE CODE THAT IS RUNNING
          There are lots of lexical environments which one i currently running id managed via execution contexts.it
          contain things beyond what you have written in your code
          And in execution context contains your code ,the running code and itâ€™s running your code, but it also can
          contain things beyond what youâ€™ve written in your code because remember again your code is being translated
          being processed by a whole other feature a whole other set of programs that someone else wrote and so itâ€™s
          executing your code and it can do other things as well and thatâ€™s whatâ€™s happening inside JavaScript.
          Execution context is whole topic by itself which we will deal in some other article.
